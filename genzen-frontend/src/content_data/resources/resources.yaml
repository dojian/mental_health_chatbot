  - title: Stress and Anxiety Reduction Activities
    content: |
      There are several methods to reduce the feelings of stress and anxiety. We encourage you to explore and practice each technique to find the activity that works best for you. 

      5-4-3-2-1 Grounding
      - Acknowledge FIVE things you see around you. It could be a pen, a spot on the ceiling, anything in your surroundings.
      - Acknowledge FOUR things you can touch around you. It could be your hair, a pillow, or the ground under your feet. 
      - Acknowledge THREE things you hear. This could be any external sound. If you can hear your belly rumbling that counts! Focus on things you can hear outside of your body.
      - Acknowledge TWO things you can smell. Maybe you are in your office and smell pencil, or maybe you are in your bedroom and smell a pillow. If you need to take a brief walk to find a scent you could smell soap in your bathroom, or nature outside.
      - Acknowledge ONE thing you can taste. What does the inside of your mouth taste like—gum, coffee, or the sandwich from lunch?

  - title: Box Breathing
    content: |
      - Make sure you’re seated upright in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor. Try to be in a stress-free, quiet environment where you can focus on your breathing.
      - Keep your hands relaxed in your lap, palms facing up, and focus on your posture. Sit up straight, which will help you take deep breaths.
      - Slowly exhale through your mouth, releasing all the oxygen from your lungs. Focus on this intention and be conscious of what you’re doing.
      - Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose to the count of 4. In this step, count to 4 very slowly in your head.
      - Hold your breath for another slow count of 4.
      - Exhale through your mouth for the same slow count of 4, expelling the air from your lungs and abdomen. Be conscious of the feeling of the air leaving your lungs.
      - Hold your breath for the same slow count of 4 before repeating this process.

  - title: Butterfly Hug
    content: |
      - Find a comfortable space (if possible) and sit up tall with your back straight.  
      - If it feels safe, close or lower your eyes and start with some deep breathing. 
      - Take space to notice any emotions or distress that may come up, continue to breathe through it.
      - Next cross your hands and place them on your chest so each middle finger rests right below the opposite collarbone. Fan your fingers, resting them on your chest.
      - Your thumbs will point towards your chin and you can interlock your thumbs so it looks like a butterfly’s body and the hands are its wings.
      - Now, alternate tapping your hands on your chest, slowly and rhythmically (left, right, left, right, etc.) for at least 8 rounds. Don’t forget your deep breathing while you’re fluttering your butterfly wings.
      - Stop and check your level of distress. If your distress has not increased try a couple more sets of 8. Stop after each set to check your level of distress, continuing if you are starting to feel less distress or more relaxed.

  - title: Body Scans
    content: |
      For a guided body scan meditation, click on the source link.
      - Find a quiet, comfortable space and settle into a relaxed position.
      - Start with a few deep breaths, then gradually direct your awareness through each body region.
      - Notice tension or sensations, accepting them without the need to change anything.
      - Each time your attention wanders, simply notice that this is happening, then gently and kindly (it’s really important that you don’t try to force anything) direct your attention back to exploring sensations in the body. Rinse and repeat until you’ve finished your entire body exploration.

  - title: Muscle Tension and Release
    content: |
      - While inhaling, contract one muscle group (for example your upper thighs) for 5 seconds to 10 seconds, then exhale and suddenly release the tension in that muscle group.
      - Give yourself 10 seconds to 20 seconds to relax, and then move on to the next muscle group (for example your buttocks).
      - While releasing the tension, try to focus on the changes you feel when the muscle group is relaxed. Imagery may be helpful in conjunction with the release of tension, such as imagining that stressful feelings are flowing out of your body as you relax each muscle group.
      Gradually work your way up the body contracting and relaxing muscle groups.
